<h1>Health and Human Services (HHS) Drupal Content Type Library: News Release</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The News Release content type is used to display content in a structured style based on industry standards for press releases. This includes having a Date Published field, Contact Office details, and the number signs (###) at the end of the body copy that indicates to media that there is no further copy to come.

<h2>Content Type Details</h2>
Contained in the /documentation folder are the content model for the News Release content type (HHS-Structured-Content-Type-NewsRelease.xlsx) which includes the Drupal field names used and their matching schema.org metadata name; and a Word Template (HHS-Structured-Content-Type-Template-NewsRelease.docx) which is a guidance document we provide to content owners to complete whenever they want a News Release to be created. The Template includes all of the fields that must be completed in order to create the News Release, as well as a taxonomy list to reference as they fill in those fields that require a taxonomy term.

<h2>Drupal Features Module</h2>
